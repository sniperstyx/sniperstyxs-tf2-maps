# sniperstyxs-tf2-maps
Just a collection of TF2 maps that I've made over the years.

Instructions on how to install those maps:
1) go to wherever TF2 is installed on your PC (usually "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2")
2) go to "..\tf\custom" (for the .VPK file) or "..\tf\download\maps" (for the .BSP files, a.k.a. the maps)
3) drag & drop the A) VPK files to "..\tf\custom" B) BSP files to "..\tf\download\maps"
4) after the maps have been installed into your game, you can launch TF2
5) go to Settings, then go to the Keyboard tab and click on "Advanced..."
6) check the box where it says "Enable Developer Console"
7) press the tilde key on your keyboard ("~") or the key that is right under the ESC key
8) type "map <map name>" (for example "map koth_warland_v7_2") and press Enter
9) congrats! you're now playing on one of my maps!

(note 1: skip steps 5 and 6 if you already have the console enabled)
  
(note 2: you don't need to have both the VPK files and the BSP files installed, unless you want to make sure that you have both installed)
